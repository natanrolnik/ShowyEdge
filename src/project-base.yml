  # We have to declare all packages in project-base.yml instead of separated in project-base.yml and project-with-codesign.yml to avoid `Could not resolve package dependencies` error,
  # when the codesign requirement is changed between builds.
  # (For example, the first build is with codesign, then the second build is without codesign.)
